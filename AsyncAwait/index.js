// Async/Await = Async = makes a function return a promise
//               Await = makes a an async func wait for a promise to resolve

//               Allow you write asynchronous code in a synchronous manner
//               Async doesn't have resolve or reject parameters
//               Everything after Await is placed in a event queue
